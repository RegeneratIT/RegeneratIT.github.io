Methods that operate on and return arrays, collections,\n\t     * and functions can be chained together. Methods that retrieve a single value\n\t     * or may return a primitive value will automatically end the chain sequence\n\t     * and return the unwrapped value. Otherwise, the value must be unwrapped\n\t     * with `_#value`.\n\t     *\n\t     * Explicit chain sequences, which must be unwrapped with `_#value`, may be\n\t     * enabled using `_.chain`.\n\t     *\n\t     * The execution of chained methods is lazy, that is, it's deferred until\n\t     * `_#value` is implicitly or explicitly called.\n\t     *\n\t     * Lazy evaluation allows several methods to support shortcut fusion.\n\t     * Shortcut fusion is an optimization to merge iteratee calls; this avoids\n\t     * the creation of intermediate arrays and can greatly reduce the number of\n\t     * iteratee executions. Sections of a chain sequence qualify for shortcut\n\t     * fusion if the section is applied to an array and iteratees accept only\n\t     * one argument. The heuristic for whether a section qualifies for shortcut\n\t     * fusion is subject to change.\n\t     *\n\t     * Chaining is supported in custom builds as long as the `_#value` method is\n\t     * directly or indirectly included in the build.\n\t     *\n\t     * In addition to lodash methods, wrappers have `Array` and `String` methods.\n\t     *\n\t     * The wrapper `Array` methods are:\n\t
